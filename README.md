# NASA-Image-Search-Engine
Winning Capitol One Challenge Entry

A web front end for searching NASA's image set. NASA maintains an API for their image and video library, which can be accessed here https://api.nasa.gov/. For the latest documentation on the NASA Image and Video Library API please go to https://images.nasa.gov/docs/images.nasa.gov_api_docs.pdf

This project attempts to provide an easy and accesible user interface for accessing NASA's expansive image library, while preserving and providing useful metadata to users.

This user interface was built with the flask webframe work and bootstrap. **IMPORTANT: This project was coded to be compatible with NASA's 2020 API. Furture changes to the NASA API and dataset could deprecate this project.**
